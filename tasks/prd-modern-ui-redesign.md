# PRD: Modern UI Redesign for Pro Fantasy Rodeo

## Introduction

Pro Fantasy Rodeo needs a cutting-edge, modern UI redesign that maintains Western charm while delivering a seamless, beautiful user experience. This redesign will elevate the application to a design award-worthy standard, drawing inspiration from top fantasy sports platforms like FanDuel and DraftKings while preserving the unique rodeo identity through selective Western elements and a signature red color palette.

## Goals

1. Transform Pro Fantasy Rodeo into a visually stunning, modern application while preserving its Western identity
2. Improve user engagement and retention through a more intuitive, satisfying interface
3. Enhance perceived value of the platform through premium design elements
4. Reduce cognitive load and improve task completion rates
5. Create a cohesive design system that can scale for future feature additions
6. Implement smooth animations and transitions that enhance the user experience
7. Ensure the interface is competitive with top fantasy sports platforms

## User Stories

- As a rodeo fan, I want an immersive, visually appealing interface that makes fantasy rodeo feel premium and exciting
- As a mobile user, I want buttery-smooth transitions and animations that make the app feel responsive and high-quality
- As a returning user, I want the app to feel modern while still maintaining the Western identity I associate with rodeo
- As a new user, I want intuitive navigation and clear visual cues that help me understand how to use the platform
- As a power user, I want sophisticated UI components that allow me to quickly access information and make decisions
- As a user in variable lighting conditions, I want appropriate contrast and readability in all environments

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Design System & Foundation

1.1. Create a comprehensive design system with consistent spacing, typography, and interaction patterns
1.2. Develop a refined color palette centered around a signature rodeo red with complementary colors
1.3. Implement a custom icon set that blends modern simplicity with subtle Western influences
1.4. Design responsive component library with consistent states (hover, active, disabled, etc.)
1.5. Define animation principles and timing functions for consistent motion design

### 2. Typography & Visual Hierarchy

2.1. Implement a modern, highly legible typeface pairing:
   - Display/Headings: A distinctive font with subtle Western character
   - Body: A clean, highly readable sans-serif optimized for mobile
2.2. Create clear typographic hierarchy with distinct styles for headings, subheadings, body text, and UI elements
2.3. Ensure all text has appropriate contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA compliance minimum)

### 3. Component Redesign

3.1. Cards & Containers
   - Design elevated card components with subtle shadows, rounded corners, and micro-interactions
   - Create glass-effect containers for premium feel (similar to FanDuel's translucent elements)
   - Implement consistent card behaviors for selection, expansion, and interaction

3.2. Buttons & Interactive Elements
   - Design a cohesive button system with primary, secondary, and tertiary variants
   - Create distinctive hover and tap states with appropriate feedback
   - Implement modern toggle switches, checkboxes, and form controls

3.3. Navigation
   - Redesign bottom navigation with floating action button for primary actions
   - Implement subtle indicator animations for active states
   - Create smooth transition effects between screens

3.4. Lists & Data Display
   - Design modern list components for contestant selection
   - Create animated data visualizations for leaderboard and statistics
   - Implement sophisticated empty and loading states

### 4. Screen-Specific Redesigns

4.1. Home Screen
   - Create an immersive hero section with subtle parallax or motion effects
   - Design modern promotional cards with clear hierarchy and CTAs
   - Implement engaging countdown visualization

4.2. Team Builder
   - Redesign contestant selection with card-swipe or tinder-like mechanics
   - Create interactive progress visualization
   - Implement subtle animations for selection confirmation

4.3. Leaderboard
   - Design data-rich yet clean leaderboard with tiered styling
   - Create animated entry for user's position highlight
   - Implement smooth sorting transitions

4.4. Contest Summary & Confirmation
   - Design visually striking team summary with contestant cards
   - Create satisfying confirmation animations
   - Implement sharable team card designs

### 5. Motion & Animation

5.1. Implement subtle micro-interactions for all user actions
5.2. Create page transition animations with shared element transitions where appropriate
5.3. Design loading and success state animations with Western character
5.4. Implement scroll-based animations and parallax effects for visual depth
5.5. Create "moments of delight" through unexpected, subtle animations

### 6. Advanced UI Features

6.1. Implement contextual blur and glass effects for layered UI elements
6.2. Create adaptive color schemes based on content (like DraftKings event-specific theming)
6.3. Design custom pull-to-refresh animations
6.4. Implement haptic feedback patterns for critical interactions
6.5. Create advanced scrolling behaviors (sticky elements, parallax, etc.)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Complete restructuring of the application architecture
- Changes to core business logic or contest rules
- Development of new features beyond UI improvements
- Complete elimination of all Western design elements
- Supporting extremely old devices or browsers
- Creation of motion graphics or video content

## Design Considerations

### Inspiration Sources
- **FanDuel**: Clean data presentation, card-based UI, subtle gradients, glassmorphism elements
- **DraftKings**: Bold typography, data visualization, color usage, micro-interactions
- **Western Elements**: Selective use of textures, accents, and iconography that evoke rodeo culture

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Refined rodeo red (#C8102E) with various tints and shades
- **Secondary**: Deep navy (#1A2B48) for contrast and depth
- **Neutrals**: Warm greys and off-whites for backgrounds and text
- **Accents**: Gold (#D4AF37) for highlights and achievements
- **Feedback**: Standard colors for success, warning, and error states

### Typography
- **Display/Headers**: [Modern font with subtle Western character]
- **Body/UI**: [Clean, highly legible sans-serif]
- **Scale**: Implement an 8pt-based type scale for consistency

### Imagery & Icons
- Custom iconography with subtle Western influence
- High-quality contestant and event photography with consistent treatment
- Selective use of texture in UI elements to evoke Western materials (leather, denim, etc.)

## Technical Considerations

- Use React Spring or Framer Motion for advanced animations
- Implement CSS variables for theming and consistency
- Consider CSS Grid for advanced layouts
- Use SVG for icons and simple animations
- Implement Intersection Observer for scroll-based effects
- Consider advanced features like WebGL for special effects on high-end devices
- Ensure animations can be reduced/disabled for users with motion sensitivity

## Success Metrics

- Increase in user engagement metrics (session length, interaction frequency)
- Improved task completion rates for team creation and submission
- Positive user feedback specifically mentioning design and experience
- Reduction in abandonment rates during critical flows
- Improved perception of brand quality and value in user research
- Competitive standing against other fantasy sports apps in design evaluation

## Open Questions

1. Should we consider a light/dark mode toggle or time-based theme switching?
2. How much customization should be allowed for users (e.g., theme preferences)?
3. Are there performance concerns for lower-end devices with advanced animations?
4. Should we implement skeleton screens for loading states?
5. How will the design scale for tablet and desktop experiences?
